    Initial git repository build. I'm not bothering with the full history,
    even though we have it. We can create a separate "historical" git
    archive of that stuff later if we want to, and in the meantime it's about
    3x smaller and probably covers 99.9% of the cases anyway.
    
    Let it rip!

    Fix up trivial merge issue: use EXTRAVERSION as ".git", not "-git"

    Make "git pull" more careful about when to test for remote tracking branches.
    
    It turns out that git will examine packs for files that don't need to
    exist at all (think "git pull" from a repository that has some references
    you'll never care about). Fix that.

    Minimal merging effort: set EXTRAVERSION to "git" rather than "-bk"

    git-update-cache: "--refresh" should consider the stat information exclusive
    
    Actually, it should _not_ look at the content when thinking about whether
    the entry is up-to-date, because the content information is about the
    _new_ file state, not the old one.
    
    git-update-cache would actually overwrite the content of a changed file if
    that file happened to be the same size as the old file. Horrible.

    update-cache --refresh: more rational handling of stat info
    
    When stat info is found to be different but the path has not
    been touched by us, overwrite the stat info with "--refresh".
    This makes status command a lot more useful.
